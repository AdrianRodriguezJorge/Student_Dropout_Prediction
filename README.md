# Prediction of Student Dropout with Logistic Regression
## Project description
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a student will drop out of their degree before completing it. Through a Logistic Regression model, we seek to identify patterns in the available information.

## Objective 
The main objective is to develop a model that, given a series of student characteristics (such as academic performance, parental educational level, etc.), allows to effectively predict whether the student is at risk of abandoning his or her career. With this information, educational institutions will be able to intervene and offer the necessary support.

#### Files:
- StudentsPerformance.csv (Dataset used to train the model)
- model_with_smote.ipynb (the model in a notebook using Smote for data processing)
- studentsPrediction.py (the interface using Streamlit)
